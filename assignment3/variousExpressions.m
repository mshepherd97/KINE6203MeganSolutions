%UNTITLED3 Summary of this function goes here
%   takes 2 numbers as input and returns values for the sum,
%   difference, product and max of the two numbers as outputs

sumNum = number1 + number2

differenceNum = number1 - number2

productNum = (number1)*(number2)

maxNum = max(number1,number2)
end
